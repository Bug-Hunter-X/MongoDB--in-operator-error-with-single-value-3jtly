# MongoDB $in Operator Error with Single Value

This example demonstrates a common error when using the `$in` operator in MongoDB queries.  The `$in` operator expects an array of values, and using it with a single value will produce unexpected results.

The `bug.js` file contains the incorrect usage, while `bugSolution.js` shows the corrected implementation.  This is a frequently encountered mistake, especially for developers new to MongoDB's query operators.  Ensuring correct usage of `$in` is crucial for accurate data retrieval.
